# Rethinking Our Approach to Chatbot Conversations

**Embracing the Uniqueness of AI Intelligence in Dialogue**

Recent advancements in AI research point to a need for a paradigm shift in how we perceive and interact with large language models, like ChatGPT. A groundbreaking study from Imperial College London, featured in *Nature*, emphasizes this shift in perspective.

## Understanding the New AI Intelligence
Large language models, which form the backbone of chatbots, are driven by intricate neural networks. These models can create an illusion of conversing with a human, not a machine. It's fascinating yet slightly unnerving how these bots mimic human-like interactions.

### The Human Brain: Wired for Social Connections
Humans are inherently social beings, always seeking connections. This trait, while beneficial in many aspects, can lead to challenges when interacting with AI. The human tendency to empathize with human-like entities opens up potential risks. Imagine a scenario where a scammer uses a chatbot to manipulate people into revealing sensitive information or influencing their political views.

## A New Study Offers Solutions
A recent publication by Professor Murray Shanahan of Imperial College Londonâ€™s Department of Computing proposes a new approach. Professor Shanahan warns against anthropomorphizing these AI models. Terms like 'understanding' or 'feeling' attributed to AI can mislead us into perceiving them as more human than they are.

### Shifting Our Perspective on AI
To truly grasp these "exotic mind-like artifacts," we need a fresh outlook. The study suggests two metaphors. Firstly, envision AI chatbots as actors playing a specific role. This simple view helps in understanding their functioning on a basic level. Secondly, for a deeper understanding, imagine these bots as simulating multiple roles, exploring a multitude of characters within a vast multiverse.

#### Embracing Multiple Metaphors
Professor Shanahan recommends a flexible approach, toggling between these metaphors. This strategy allows for a more comprehensive and balanced understanding of AI agents.

In conclusion, as we continue to integrate AI into our lives, it's crucial to adapt our thinking and language. This not only enhances our interaction with AI but also safeguards us from potential manipulations.
